# AR-VR-Smart-Watch
### A simple application that gives you the feel of a futuristic smart watch. 
- Print out the image in this link -> https://github.com/dikshayp/AR-VR-Smart-Watch/blob/master/stones_hires.jpg


- Use the image as a dial and attach straps to it like in a watch. 


- Now run the application and place it in google cardboard.
The dial of the image gets replaced by a digital watch.


- You will also find 3 buttons on the left to display your current location on map(enable location), popup a 3d animation and
to get the current temperature depending on your location.

## Requirements
### Vuforia(Only if you want to add custom images)
Create a account in Vuforia. They have a option to upload an image. Upload any image you want (this will be the dial of the watch that we will use for image recognition).Copy the key that they provide.
### Unity
Load the application in Unity and build the application for android and generate apk file and run it in your android device.
Custom Images: You will have to add the key that you got in Vuforia here. Use this tutorial for reference: https://www.sitepoint.com/how-to-build-an-ar-android-app-with-vuforia-and-unity/
